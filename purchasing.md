## Thanks for considering buying TotalFinder

The process is straight-forward and should take less than 5 minutes in 3 steps.

## Step 1: Buy a license from [the web store](https://www.binaryage.com/store)

Go to the [store](https://www.binaryage.com/store) via the top menu of [www.binaryage.com](https://www.binaryage.com).

If you're considering buying also a [TotalSpaces](https://totalspaces.binaryage.com) license, you should buy the "BinaryAge Bundle" at a better price.

Alternatively you can go directly via "Buy TotalFinder" button at [totalfinder.binaryage.com](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com):

## Step 2: Wait for an email with "TotalFinder License" in the subject

In most cases you should get it instantly after the payment.

We all know that even important emails can sometimes end up in a spam folder. Please double check your spam before you [report a missing email](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=Didn't%20get%20registration%20email). I'm using [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com) which has been rock-solid. A mistake by our email robot is unlikely.

In my Gmail the message looks like this:
