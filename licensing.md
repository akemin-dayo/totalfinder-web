## The license agreement

When you buy a TotalFinder license you receive a permission to use the software.

<div class="license-desk">
  <p>You may use your license in either of two ways:</p>
  <div class="choice">1. <strong>one user on multiple computers</strong> <span class="note">(as long as you are the only user using TotalFinder)</span></div>
  <div class="example">Example: a desktop computer and a personal laptop which are both used exclusively by you</div>
  <div class="choice">2. <strong>multiple users on a single computer</strong></div>
  <div class="example">Example: a home computer which is shared by all family members</div>
</div>

## Trial Version

You may install TotalFinder and use it in trial mode for 14 days. Then you have to buy it or uninstall it.

The trial version displays an info badge in the top-right part of every TotalFinder window:

<img src="/images/trial.png" class="doc-image add-shadow" style="width: 400px;">

After 14 days it starts showing the red "unregistered" badge:

<img src="/images/unregistered.png" class="doc-image add-shadow" style="width: 400px;">

This allows you to evaluate TotalFinder's functionality and decide whether you want to buy it or not.

## Buying a license

Please **[visit our store](http://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage-store/product/all)** where you can purchase TotalFinder. It should be easy and safe (via [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com)).

## TotalFinder updates

When you buy a license you may freely update to all TotalFinder versions within one major macOS release. 
Please keep TotalFinder up-to-date to prevent any potential compatibility issues with system updates.

A new major macOS release might require substantial rewrites and intensive testing.
I might decide to charge existing users an upgrade fee. I expect it to be 50% of the full price. 
But historically I was able to reuse most of my work in new OS releases. 
All updates have been free of charge so far.

## TotalFinder and your privacy

TotalFinder does not communicate over the network. It works perfectly on a computer disconnected from the internet.

There are two cases in which TotalFinder optionally sends data over the network:

* **[Sparkle Updating System](https://sparkle-project.org)** - when checking for and downloading a new version.
* **[Crash Reporting Dialog](https://blog.binaryage.com/crash-reporting-in-binaryage)** - when you explicitly click the "Send Report..." button.

## TotalFinder reliability

I have tested TotalFinder with my system and I did my best to make it bug-free and reasonably stable. 
However it still may contain undiscovered bugs or hard-to-fix issues. 
Please report them on [our forums](https://discuss.binaryage.com) or privately via email at [support@binaryage.com](mailto:support@binaryage.com).

<div class="license-desk exclamation">
You are using TotalFinder at your own risk. I'm not responsible for anything bad which could possibly happen using this software.
</div>

But don't worry as far as I know no disasters have happened to anyone because of TotalFinder over last years.

<div class="license-desk exclamation">
I'm not in control of what Apple does with Finder in the future. 
Some future system update might make it impossible for me to adapt TotalFinder or some of its functionality to a new Finder version. 
By purchasing and using this software you simply accept this risk.
