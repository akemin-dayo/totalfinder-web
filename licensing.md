## The license agreement

When you buy a TotalFinder license you receive a permission to use the software.

<div class="license-desk">
  <p>You may use your license in either of two ways:</p>
  <div class="choice">1. <strong>one user on multiple computers</strong> <span class="note">(as long as you are the only user using TotalFinder)</span></div>
  <div class="example">Example: a desktop computer and a personal laptop which are both used exclusively by you</div>
  <div class="choice">2. <strong>multiple users on a single computer</strong></div>
  <div class="example">Example: a home computer which is shared by all family members</div>
</div>

## Trial Version

You may install TotalFinder and use it in trial mode for 14 days. Then you have to buy it or uninstall it.

The trial version displays an info badge in the top-right part of every window:

<img src="/images/trial.png" class="doc-image add-shadow border-radius-top-right-only" style="width: 200px;">

After 14 days it starts showing the unregistered badge:

<img src="/images/unregistered.png" class="doc-image add-shadow border-radius-top-right-only" style="width: 200px;">

This allows you to evaluate TotalFinder's functionality and decide whether you want to buy it or not.

## Buying a license

Please **[visit our store](http://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/product/store)** where you can purchase TotalFinder. It should be easy and safe (via [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com)).

## TotalFinder updates

When you buy a license you may freely update to all TotalFinder versions within one major OS release. 
For example by buying TotalFinder today you will get free updates for all versions compatible with Mavericks (OS X 10.9). Please keep TotalFinder up-to-date to prevent compatibility issues with system updates.

A new major OS release (OS X 10.10?) will probably require substantial rewrites and intensive testing. I may charge existing users an upgrade fee for a new OS. I expect it to be 50% of the full price. But historically I was able to reuse most of my work in new OS releases. All updates have been free of charge so far.

## TotalFinder and your privacy

TotalFinder does not communicate over the network. It works perfectly on a computer disconnected from the internet.

There are two cases in which TotalFinder optionally sends data over the network:

* **[Sparkle Updating System](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/)** - when checking for and downloading a new version.
* **[Crash Reporting Dialog](http://blog.binaryage.com/crash-reporting-in-binaryage)** - when you explicitly click "Send Report..." button.

## TotalFinder reliability

I have tested TotalFinder with my system and I did my best to make it bug-free and stable. However it still may contain bugs or issues.

<div class="license-desk exclamation">
You are using TotalFinder at your own risk. I'm not responsible for anything bad which could possibly happen using this software.
</div>

Note: As far as I know no disasters have happened to anyone because of TotalFinder over last 5 years.

<div class="license-desk exclamation">
I'm not in control of what Apple does with Finder in the future. Some future update might make it impossible for me to adapt TotalFinder or some of its functionality to a new Finder version. By using this software you accept this risk.
