  ! TotalFinder tabs render nicely on Retina MacBooks (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/retina_support-347pw">issue</a>)
  ! Visor auto-slides down when Finder loses active status. This should fix unreliable sliding historicaly based on losing keyboard focus (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/autohiding_visor_doent_work_reliably">issue</a>).

1.2.5 - August 11, 2011
  + New Tab command opens default window location as set in General Finder Preferences. Previously it was opening the same location as the current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices can be stuck in DMG view without sidebar (Lion does not have pill button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with sidebar is not very well known keyboard shortcut).

  * Fixed tab focus problem when creating tabs by dragging folders into tab bar.
  * TotalFinder reports reasonable error message when fails launching.
  - TotalFinder is not using Spotlight anymore to locate TotalFinder.app if not found on standard location.

  * Moved traffic lights placement to match the Chrome (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/copy_chromiums_new_traffic_light_placement">issue</a>).

  ! Fixed disjointed UI during Visor activation when clicking icons in the Dock and the Desktop. (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/visor_bug_in_version_1_1_2">issue</a>).
  * The cut-operation cooperates better with system clipboard. (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/cutting_files_folders_and_finders_clipboard">issue</a>)

  ! Fixed "Go To ..." keyboard shortcuts in Dual Mode (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/folder_navigation_problem_in_dual_pane_mode">issue</a>).

  * Tab title is now truncated from the beginning, which makes sense for folks using _FXShowPosixPathInTitle tweak (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/unix_paths_in_title_should_truncate_start_not_end">issue</a>).

  $ More details in the blog post: <a href="http://blog.binaryage.com/totalfinder-summer-update/">TotalFinder summer update</a>
  ! Fixed occasional crashing when dropping a tab. This was reproducible by ninjas who were able to drag&drop a tab and immediately move mouse over dying semi-transparent window.
  ! Possibly fixed the crash when Finder decided to deallocate its window and some of my code cached pointer to it and didn't notice it is already gone. This was rarely reproducible.

  + Added toolbar pill button to the top-right corner of the main chrome window. Yaay! (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/toolbar_pill_button_missing">issue</a>).
  * Sidebar and toolbar toggling should work more reliably and without visual glitches.
  * Using <a href="http://github.com/darwin/chromium-src-chrome-browser/commit/a460417f45efb3bf19aea54acbb782a968454a43">zombies</a> - better internal tracking of unintentional usage of deallocated memory. This should help me fix some remaining crashes.

  ! Fixed installer bug when TotalFinder failed to install with unselected TotalFinder.kext (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/install_problems_without_admin_rights_with_0_9">issue</a> and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/installation_of_totalfinder_0_83_fails_without_apparent_reason">issue</a>).
  ! Visor's Pin button is click-through.

Clicking right-side close button of dualized tab closes the right-side Finder panel properly (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/left_right_tab_closing_issue">issue</a> and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/closing_right_pane_in_dual_mode_actually_closes_left_one">issue</a>).

  + New Tweak option 'Always Maximize' - makes Zoom behave like in Google Chrome.
  + New Tweak option 'Narrow Tabs Bar' - saves some vertical space for folks with 13" notebooks.
  + CMD+Q closes all open windows. This does not terminate Finder process tough.

  * Better logic for selecting target browser for a new tab: open it in visor if visor is visible and key window else use last active non-visor window.
  * Overall refactorings, dead code removal and speed improvements.
  * Dual panel separator line goes over toolbar and statusbar.
  - Removed close button on Visor window.
  - Removed continuous crash preventer code (not needed anymore).

  * Renamed some status menu items and added "Check for Updates" item.
  * Pixel perfect sidebar width syncing in dual mode.
  
0.8.1 - March 11, 2010
