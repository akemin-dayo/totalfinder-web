## Do you know .DS_Store files?

Asepsis allows you to redirect creation of .DS_Store files. This feature is particularly useful for people who use command-line tools.

Asepsis was removed from TotalFinder into a separate product. Please read more at [asepsis.binaryage.com](https://asepsis.binaryage.com).
