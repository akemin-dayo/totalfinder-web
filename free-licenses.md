First, you might want to read why I think [TotalFinder is worth purchasing](/reasons-to-buy). Free licenses are for people who contributed or helped TotalFinder in some way.

## Free licenses for users

I will grant a free license to you if you meet any of these criterias:

1. you **helped directly** in TotalFinder development (e.g. [translators](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors) -> [visit this page](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n) to help with translation)
2. you created or significantly **contributed to an open-source project** I've used in TotalFinder
3. you are **a public speaker** and send me a link to your talk (must be recorded and publicly available on YouTube or a similar site)
4. you are **a Google engineer** with a valid `someone@google.com` email address
5. you are **an Apple employee** with a valid `someone@apple.com` email address
6. you have **[bitcoins](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/bitcoin-inside-the-encrypted-peer-to-peer-currency.ars)** and want to [trade them for TotalFinder](http://blog.binaryage.com/trade-totalfinder-bitcoin)
7. you feel that you deserve a free license for **some other reason** (being short on money is not a good reason)

Please [drop me an email](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=Free%20TotalFinder%20license%20request) and I will send you a free license link back if you meet the criteria.

## Free licenses for the press

Journalists and bloggers may apply for a TotalFinder license if they plan to review it.

I love to read articles about TotalFinder and I will be happy to [give you a NFR (Not-For-Resale) license](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=NFR%20TotalFinder%20license%20request) in exchange.
