## Keep original Dock icon

When TotalFinder is running, by default the Finder's Dock icon is replaced with one that has a tab on it. This options keeps the original Finder icon instead.

## Show progress bar in the Dock

During long file operations, you can show a mini progress bar just below the Finder's dock icon with this option enabled.
